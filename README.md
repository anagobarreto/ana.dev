New website
Hello! I'm currently working on my website as of November 2022! If you're a recruiter say hi! Most of my projects were hosted in HEROKU and they're down so I'm working on changing them over to Netlify. 

Work images are placeholders of Nicolas Cage, they'll be slowly replaced as I work on the respective pages. I'll also be updating this readme almost every day as sometimes recruiters just look at the green contribuition squares so I gotta keep those in check somehow LOL
