<p><Welcome to my first project for the WDI course in GA London. I decided to create a traditional roguelike game with pixel art graphics. I redrew most of the art by using make8bitart, and recorded most of the sounds at home.

    I learned how to draw the levels by reading the chapter 15 of Eloquent Javascript. Writing this game was a bit tricky in the beginning, once I got used to the logic it turned fairly simple as I had to repeat most of it for the different scenarios.
    
    Id say that the attacks of the enemies and the potions were the most challenging part of the creation of this game. I enjoyed a lot drawing most of the stuff and making it more personalized.</p>
