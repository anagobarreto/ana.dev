<p>Welcome to my second project for the WDI course in GA London. I decided to create a website involving one of my passions: Tattoos. I chose for it to be a website that people would be able to find their next tattoo artist or inspiration for their next tattoo.

    I enjoyed creating something that I could easily see being used by my friends and people in the tattoo industry.
